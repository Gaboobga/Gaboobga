### About me:
I like solving problems with technology: from clean, responsive web interfaces to dashboards and automations that save time.

* I’m currently a **Business Intelligence** student at **Tecnológico de Monterrey** and training as a **Web Developer (Front-end & Back-end)** at **TripleTen**, building real projects and continuously expanding my technical stack. :telescope:

* I build web applications with **HTML, CSS (BEM), and JavaScript (ES6)**, integrating **APIs** and using **Git/GitHub** for version control and production deployment. :computer:

* I also have experience in **data analytics** with **Python and R**, and in building **dashboards** (for example, with **Streamlit**) to turn data into actionable insights. :bar_chart:

* I’m building **Posterum**, an **AI Automation** agency where I develop workflows with **n8n** and integrations for **WhatsApp/Instagram/Facebook**. :robot:

* I’m always learning and improving—motivated by solving problems and building clear solutions that connect product, data, and automation. :seedling:
